Part 1: Data
Background on the GSS
Execerpted from the GSS website:

The GSS gathers data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes. Hundreds of trends have been tracked since 1972. In addition, since the GSS adopted questions from earlier surveys, trends can be followed for up to 70 years.

The GSS contains a standard core of demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal questions, plus topics of special interest. Among the topics covered are civil liberties, crime and violence, intergroup tolerance, morality, national spending priorities, psychological well-being, social mobility, and stress and traumatic events.

Altogether the GSS is the single best source for sociological and attitudinal trend data covering the United States. It allows researchers to examine the structure and functioning of society in general as well as the role played by relevant subgroups and to compare the United States to other nations.

The GSS aims to make high-quality data easily accessible to scholars, students, policy makers, and others, with minimal cost and waiting.

Part 2: Research question
The research question chosen was:

Is there a relationship between a respondent’s region of residence and their confidence in the scientific community?

This is an important question as it can help those in the scientific community perform better outreach to communities. Understanding how the audience perceives the messenger is important in crafting the delivery of a message: can the message - be it climate change, biomedical research, energy policy, etc… - be discussed directly, or does there need to be confidence-building before that?

Based on that question, the analysis was done using the following variables:

year - Year the response was obtained.
region - Region of interview.
consci - Confidence in the scientific community.
